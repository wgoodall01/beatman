Beatman is a web-based manager for beatsaber songs. 
I wasn't really happy with BeatDrop, and I wanted something that would work over a network.

Install modes:
	Live as an .exe in the BeatSaber install folder:
		Use inconshreveable/mousetrap to detect launches from Explorer (or maybe a different build?)
		Open a webserver on localhost, open a web browser to that port.
		No auth.
	Live in a Docker container.
#		Mounts /beatsaber: Something approximating the BeatSaber install dir.
		Opens a port, web UI. Auth with simple tokens, basic auth, or smth. 


Backend: 
#	Look at a beatsaber installs dir (basically, CustomSongs and Playlists)
	Load song zip files (currently only extracted dirs work)
	HTTP request for song audio. /api/audio/xxxxx-xxxxx -> <whatever path it actually is>
	HTTP request for song cover. /api/cover/xxxxx-xxxxx -> <whatever the cover is>
	HTTP request to ingest a song/playlist zip, or playlist manifest.
#	GraphQL API for songs, playlists.

Queries:
#	Search that isn't awful. Bleve? When does indexing happen?
	Song:
#		Title, artist, meta, etc. 
		Preview audio. (over network? how does beatdrop do it?)
		Query info out of various mods.
	Playlist:
		song list
		Download all songs
	Downloads:
		Pending downloads. Poll this for something resembling a download queue.
		List song/playlist-manifest downloads.

Mutations:
	Take a song.zip download URL and fetch the song.
	Take a playlist.json (or playlist.zip) download URL, and fetch the playlist (with songs?)
